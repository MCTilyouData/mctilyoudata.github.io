<img src="images/Medical Picture.jpg?raw=true"/>
Using data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, I worked with over 100,000 patient Ids in SQL. By joining demographic and health tables, I was able to compare things like typical lengths of stay in the hospital to the number of lab procedures, 
differences between medical specialties and number of procedures, and more!

In this case study, I was prompted to analyze data from the World Bank IDA. Using SQL, I worked with over 1.25 milltion rows and looked into how money was distributed between different countries. After deciding to focus on Africa specifically, I found things like the total amount distributed to Africa, the amount of money that has been forgiven, and the top projects the commitments were for.

<img src="images/Basketball.jpg?raw=true"/> 
Using a story format in Tableau, I analyzed NBA stats and created various visualizations like heat maps, tree maps, and bubble plots. These visualizations show things like what position has the most efficient 3-point shots, how each teams total scores stack up, comparing each individual player as well, and which players had the most assists on each team.

<img src="images/Door DASh.png?raw=true"/>
In this case study from Data Analytics Accelerator, I was prompted to analyze Door Dash revenue from different marketing campaigns in Excel. The main focuses were:
Which age groups were generating the most revenue and from what products?
How could marketing target certain age groups to generate more income?
What types of households spent the most money?
