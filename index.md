In this case study, I was prompted to analyze data from the World Bank IDA. Using SQL, I worked with over 1.25 milltion rows and looked into how money was distributed between different countries. After deciding to focus on Africa specifically, I found things like the total amount distributed to Africa, the amount of money that has been forgiven, and the top projects the commitments were for.

Which age groups were generating the most revenue and from what products?
