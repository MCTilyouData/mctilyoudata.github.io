#**Africa and the World Bank: Analyzing Support from the IDA**
<br>
The **International Development Association (IDA)** is a branch of the World Bank Group and 
is headquarted in Washington, D.C. in the United States. The branch was created in 1960 and aims at providing 
concessional loans and grants to the world's poorest developing countries to help end extreme
poverty and promote shared prosperity. IDA is funded largely by contributions from the governments
of its member countries. To date, thirty-six countries have graduated, and many of them have become IDA donors themselves. 
These countries include China, Chile, India, South Korea, and Turkey. 

In recent years, the African region has received 75% of the total IDA commitments, with the country of Africa
receiving the most. To see where the IDA's commitments were disbursed and how the money was being used, the data
was displayed and analyzed in SQL.
